              Spirochaetes belong to a phylum of distinctive diderm (double-membrane) bacteria,

                Spirochaetes are distinguished from other bacterial phyla by the location of their flagella,
                sometimes called axial filaments, which run lengthwise between the bacterial inner membrane and
                outer membrane in periplasmic space. These cause a twisting motion which allows the
                spirochaete to move about.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most spirochaetes are free-living and anaerobic, but there are numerous exceptions.

                    <p>Syphilis is a chronic systemic infection caused by <em>Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum</em> (Treponema
                    pallidum pallidum). It is usually sexually transmitted and is characterized by episodes of active disease interrupted by periods of latency.</p>
                    
                    <h4>The Organism</h4>
                    <p><em>T. pallidum subspecies pallidum</em> (commonly referred to as <em>T. pallidum</em>) is a thin, delicate organism with 6 to
                    14 spirals and tapered ends. It measures 6 to 15 um in total length and 0.2um in width. The only known natural host for <em>T. pallidum</em> is the human. Although <em>T. pallidum</em> can infect many mammals, only humans, higher apes, and a few laboratory animals regularly develop syphilitic lesions.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Epidemiology</h4>
                    <p>In 1999, there were 12 million people infected with syphilis. 90% of cases occur in developing countries, where it accounts for 20% of perinatal deaths. Syphilis affects 700,000-1.6 million pregnancies a year, causing spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and congenital syphilis. In Nigeria, at UBTH, seropositivity in blood bank donors was 16% in females and 3.4% in males aged 30-34 years.</p>
                    <p>In developed countries, infections declined in the 1980s-1990s but have been increasing in the UK, US, Australia, and Europe due to an increase in multiple sexual partners. Syphilis increases the rate of HIV transmission by 2-5 times, and co-infection is common in urban settings (30-60%). Untreated syphilis has a mortality rate of 8-58%, with males being more affected than females. The severity of symptoms decreased in the 20th century due to decreased virulence of the organism and the widespread availability of effective treatment. Early treatment is crucial in preventing complications.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Modes of Transmission</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Nearly all cases of syphilis are acquired by sexual contact with infectious lesions (i.e., the chancre, mucous patch, skin rash, or condyloma latum).</li>
                      <li>One in two sexual contacts of infected people becomes infected.</li>
                      <li>Less common modes of transmission include:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Non-sexual personal contact</li>
                        <li>Infection in utero</li>
                        <li>Blood transfusion</li>
                      </ul>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h4>Natural Course and Pathogenesis of Untreated Syphilis</h4>
                    <p><em>Treponema pallidum</em> rapidly penetrates intact mucous membranes or microscopic abrasions in the skin. Within a few hours, it enters the lymphatics and blood to produce systemic infection and metastatic foci long before the appearance of a primary lesion. The <strong>incubation period</strong> of syphilis is inversely proportional to the number of organisms inoculated. The concentration of treponemes generally reaches at least <strong>10^7/g</strong> of tissue before the appearance of a clinical lesion. The median incubation period in humans is approximately <strong>21 days</strong>, and the incubation period (from inoculation until the primary lesion becomes discernible) rarely exceeds <strong>6 weeks</strong>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The <strong>primary lesion</strong> appears at the site of inoculation, usually persists for 4 to 6 weeks, and then heals spontaneously. Phagocytosis of organisms by activated macrophages ultimately causes their destruction, resulting in the spontaneous resolution of the <strong>chancre</strong>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The generalized parenchymal, constitutional, and mucocutaneous manifestations of <strong>secondary syphilis</strong> usually appear about <strong>6 to 8 weeks</strong> after the healing of the chancre, though in some patients, it may take several months. Generalized non-tender lymphadenopathy is also noted in <strong>85%</strong> of patients with secondary syphilis. Approximately <strong>15%</strong> of patients with secondary syphilis still have persisting or healing chancres.</p>
                    
                    <p>Some patients may enter the <strong>latent stage</strong> without ever recognizing secondary lesions. Treponemes are found in many tissues, including the aqueous humor of the eye and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Invasion of the CNS by <em>T. pallidum</em> occurs during the first weeks or months of infection. CSF abnormalities are detected in as many as <strong>40%</strong> of patients during the secondary stage.</p>
                    
                    <p>Secondary lesions subside within <strong>2 to 6 weeks</strong>, and the infection enters the <strong>latent stage</strong>, which is detectable only by serologic testing. In the preantibiotic era, up to <strong>25%</strong> of untreated patients experienced at least one generalized or localized mucocutaneous relapse, usually during the first year. Therefore, identification and examination of sexual contacts are most important for patients with syphilis of less than <strong>1 year's</strong> duration. Recurrent generalized rash is now rare.</p>
                    

                    <h4>Effect of the Antibiotic Era</h4>
                    <p>In the <strong>pre-antibiotic era</strong>, about one-third of patients with untreated latent syphilis developed clinically apparent tertiary disease; today, in industrialized countries, specific treatment and coincidental therapy for early and latent syphilis have all but eliminated tertiary disease except for sporadic cases of neurosyphilis in persons infected with HIV.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Tuskegee study of 1932-1972</strong></p>
                    <h4>The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male</h4>
                    <p>The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male was a clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the US government on nearly 400 African American men with syphilis. The purpose of the study was to observe the natural history of untreated syphilis, but participants were not informed of the nature of the study and were not offered treatment, even after penicillin became the standard treatment for syphilis in 1943.</p>
                    
                    <p>The study was ethically unjustified and a gross violation of human rights. The participants were deceived and exploited, and many of them died as a result of the study. The study also had a devastating impact on the trust between the Black community and the public health system.</p>
                    
                    <p>The study was stopped in 1972 after an Associated Press story about the study was published. The US government apologized for the study in 1997 and reached a $9 million settlement with the survivors and their families in 1998.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Tuskegee Study is a reminder of the importance of ethical standards in research and the need to protect the rights of human subjects. It is also a reminder of the legacy of racism and discrimination in the US public health system.</p>

                            <p>The typical <strong>primary chancre</strong> usually begins as a single <strong>painless papule</strong> that rapidly becomes
                            <strong>eroded</strong> and usually becomes <strong>indurated</strong>, with a characteristic <strong>cartilaginous consistency</strong> on
                            palpation of the edge and base of the ulcer.</p>
                            
                            <p>In heterosexual men, the chancre is usually located on the <strong>penis</strong>. In homosexual men, it is often
                            found in the <strong>anal canal</strong> or <strong>rectum</strong>, in the <strong>mouth</strong>, or on the <strong>external genitalia</strong>. In women, common primary sites are the <strong>cervix</strong> and <strong>labia</strong>.</p>

              <p><strong>Multiple primary lesions</strong> may be more common among men with concurrent HIV infection.</p>
                  <p>Regional lymphadenopathy usually accompanies the primary syphilitic lesion, appearing within <strong>1 week</strong> of the onset of the lesion.</p>
                  <p>The nodes are firm, non-suppurative, and painless. Inguinal lymphadenopathy is bilateral and may occur with anal as well as with external genital chancres.</p>
                  <p>The chancre generally heals within <strong>4 to 6 weeks</strong> (range: 2 to 12 weeks), but lymphadenopathy may persist for months. Atypical primary lesions are produced by small inoculums of the organism - small papule.</p>

                    <h4>SECONDARY SYPHILIS</h4>
                    <p><strong>Protean manifestations</strong></p>
                    <p>Localized or diffuse symmetric <strong>mucocutaneous lesions</strong> and generalized <strong>non-tender
                    lymphadenopathy</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The healing <strong>primary chancre</strong> is still present in 15% of cases, and the stages may overlap
                    more frequently in persons with concurrent <strong>HIV infection</strong> than in those without this coinfection.</p>
                    <p>The skin rash consists of <strong>macular, papular, papulosquamous, and occasionally pustular
                    syphilides</strong>; often more than one form is present simultaneously.</p>
                    <p>Initial lesions are bilaterally symmetric, pale red or pink, <strong>non-pruritic</strong>, discrete, round <strong>macules</strong> that
                    measure <strong>5 to 10 mm</strong> in diameter and are distributed on the trunk and proximal extremities.</p>

                        <p>Constitutional symptoms that may accompany or precede secondary syphilis include <strong>sore throat</strong>
                          (15 to 30%), <strong>fever</strong> (5 to 8%), <strong>weight loss</strong> (2 to 20%), <strong>malaise</strong> (25%), <strong>anorexia</strong> (2 to 10%), <strong>headache</strong>
                          (10%), and <strong>meningismus</strong> (5%).</p>
                          <p><strong>Acute meningitis</strong> occurs in only 1 to 2% of cases, but numbers of cells and levels of protein in
                          CSF are increased in >30% of cases. <strong>T. pallidum</strong> has been recovered from CSF during
                          primary and secondary syphilis in 30% of cases; this finding is often but not always associated
                          with other CSF abnormalities.</p>
                          <p>Less common complications of secondary syphilis include:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hepatitis</strong> - usually <strong>ASYMPTOMATIC</strong>. Pt has abnormal liver function test.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nephropathy</strong> - produces proteinuria associated with an acute nephrotic syndrome (or rarely with
                              hemorrhagic glomerulonephritis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gastrointestinal involvement</strong> (hypertrophic gastritis, patchy proctitis, ulcerative colitis, or a
                              rectosigmoid mass).</li>
                            <li><strong>Arthritis,</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Periostitis.</strong></li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Ocular findings that suggest secondary syphilis include otherwise-unexplained pupillary
                          abnormalities, optic neuritis, and a retinitis pigmentosa syndrome
                          the classic iritis (especially granulomatous iritis) or uveitis.</p>
                          <p>Like those of primary syphilis, the manifestations of the secondary stage resolve
                          spontaneously, usually within 1 to 6 months.</p>


                          <h4>LATENT SYPHILIS</h4>
                          <p>Positive serologic tests for syphilis, together with abnormal CSF examination and the absence of
                          clinical manifestations of syphilis, indicate a diagnosis of latent syphilis.</p>
                          <p>The diagnosis is often suspected on the basis of a history of primary or secondary lesions, a
                          history of exposure to syphilis, or the delivery of an infant with congenital syphilis.</p>
                          <p>Early latent syphilis encompasses the first year after infection, whereas late latent syphilis
                          (beginning >1 year after infection in the untreated patient) is associated with relative immunity to
                          infectious relapse.</p>
                          <p>However, <strong>T. pallidum</strong> may still seed the bloodstream intermittently during the latent stage, and
                          pregnant women with latent syphilis may infect the fetus in utero.</p>
                          <p>Moreover, syphilis has been transmitted through the transfusion of blood from patients with
                          latent syphilis of many years‚Äô duration.</p>
                          <p>It was previously thought that untreated late latent syphilis had three possible outcomes:
                          (1) it could persist throughout the lifetime of the infected individual;
                          (2) it could end in the development of late syphilis;
                          or (3) it could end with the spontaneous cure of infection, with reversion of serologic tests to
                          negative.</p>
                          <p>It is now apparent, however, that the more sensitive treponemal antibody tests rarely, if ever,
                          become negative without treatment.</p>
                          <p>About 70% of untreated patients with latent syphilis never develop clinically evident late syphilis,
                          but the occurrence of spontaneous cure is in doubt.</p>
                          <p><strong>Involvement of the Central Nervous System</strong></p>
                          <p>Traditionally, neurosyphilis has been considered to be a late manifestation of syphilis, but this
                          view is inaccurate.</p>
                          <p>CNS syphilis represents a continuum encompassing early invasion (usually within the first weeks
                          or months of infection), months to years of asymptomatic involvement, and, in some cases,
                          development of early or late neurologic manifestations.</p>
                          
                          <p><strong>ASYMPTOMATIC NEUROSYPHILIS</strong></p>
                          <p>The diagnosis of asymptomatic neurosyphilis is made in patients who lack neurologic symptoms
                          and signs but
                          who have CSF abnormalities including mononuclear pleocytosis, increased protein
                          concentrations, or a reactive Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) slide test.</p>
                          <p>This occurs in 25% of pts with untreated latent syphilis. These are the patients who are known to
                          be at risk for neurologic complications.</p>
                          <p>In patients with untreated asymptomatic neurosyphilis, the overall cumulative probability of
                          progression to clinical neurosyphilis is about 20% in the first 10 years but increases with time; the
                          likelihood is highest among patients with the greatest degree of pleocytosis or protein elevation.</p>
                          

                          <p><strong>SYMPTOMATIC NEUROSYPHILIS</strong></p>
                          <p>Although mixed features are common, the major clinical categories of symptomatic neurosyphilis
                          include meningeal, meningovascular, and parenchymatous syphilis. The last category includes
                          general paresis and tabes dorsalis.</p>
                          <p>The onset of symptoms usually comes &lt;1 year after infection for meningeal syphilis, at 5 to 10
                          years for meningovascular syphilis, at 20 years for general paresis, and at 25 to 30 years for
                          tabes dorsalis.</p>
                          <p>However, symptomatic neurosyphilis, particularly in the antibiotic era, often presents not as a
                          classic picture but rather as mixed and subtle or incomplete syndromes including:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Meningeal syphilis may involve either the brain or the spinal cord, and patients may present with
                            headache, nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, cranial nerve involvement, seizures, and changes in
                            mental status. This condition may be concurrent with or may follow the secondary stage.</li>
                            <li>Patients presenting with uveitis or iritis frequently have meningeal syphilis.</li>
                            <li>Meningovascular syphilis reflects diffuse inflammation of the pia and arachnoid together with
                            evidence of focal or widespread arterial involvement of small, medium, or large vessels.
                            The most common presentation is a stroke syndrome involving the middle cerebral artery of a
                            relatively young adult; however, unlike the usual thrombotic or embolic stroke syndrome of
                            sudden onset, meningovascular syphilis often becomes manifest after a subacute encephalitic
                            prodrome (with headaches, vertigo, insomnia, and psychological
                            abnormalities), which is followed by a gradually progressive vascular syndrome.</li>
                            <li>General paresis The manifestations of general paresis reflect widespread late parenchymal
                            damage and include abnormalities corresponding to the mnemonic paresis:

                          <p><strong>Tabes dorsalis</strong> is also a late manifestation of syphilis that presents as symptoms and signs of
                            demyelination of the posterior columns, dorsal roots, and dorsal root ganglia.</p>
                            <p>Symptoms include ataxic wide-based gait and footslap; paresthesia; bladder disturbances;
                            impotence; areflexia; and loss of position, deep pain, and temperature sensations.</p>
                            <p>Trophic joint degeneration (Charcot‚Äôs joints) and perforating ulceration of the feet can result from
                            loss of pain sensation. The small, irregular Argyll Robertson pupil, a feature of both tabes dorsalis
                            and paresis, reacts to accommodation but not to light.</p>
                            <p>Optic atrophy also occurs frequently in association with Tabes.</p>

                          <p>The RPR and VDRL tests are equally sensitive and may be used for initial screening or for
                          quantitation of serum antibody. The titer reflects the activity of the disease. Titers rise during the
                          evolution of early syphilis; VDRL titers usually reach 1:32 or higher in secondary syphilis.
                          A persistent fall by two dilutions (fourfold) or more after treatment of early syphilis provides
                          essential evidence of an adequate response to therapy. VDRL titers do not correspond directly to
                          RPR titers, and sequential quantitative testing (as for response to therapy) must employ a single
                          test.</p>

                          <p><strong>The three uses of serologic tests for syphilis:</strong></p>

                            <li>Testing of large numbers of sera for screening or diagnostic purposes (e.g., the RPR or VDRL test)</li>
                            <li>Quantitative measurement of antibody titer to assess the clinical activity of syphilis or to
                            monitor the response to therapy (e.g., the RPR or VDRL test)</li>
                            <li>Confirmation of the diagnosis of syphilis in a patient with a positive non-treponemal antibody
                            test or with a suspected clinical diagnosis of syphilis (e.g., the FTA-ABS test or the Serodia TP-PA test)</li>
                          </ol>
                          <p><strong>False-Positive Serologic Tests for Syphilis</strong></p>
                          <p>Because the antigen used in non-treponemal tests is found in other tissues, the tests may be
                          reactive in persons without treponemal infection, although rarely do titers exceed 1:8 in such
                          patients.</p>
                          <p><strong>Evaluation for Neurosyphilis</strong></p>
                          <p>Involvement of the CNS is detected by examination of CSF for
                          pleocytosis (>5 white blood cells/mm3), increased protein concentration (>45 mg/dL), or VDRL
                          reactivity.</p>
                          <p>CSF abnormalities can be demonstrated in up to 40% of cases of primary or secondary syphilis
                          and in 25% of cases of latent syphilis.</p>
                          <p>The CSF VDRL test is highly specific but is insensitive and may be nonreactive
                          even in cases of progressive symptomatic neurosyphilis.</p>

                      <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
                      <p>Yaws, also known as pian, framboesia, or bouba, is a chronic infection caused by <strong>Treponema pallidum</strong> subspecies <strong>pertenue</strong>. It is typically acquired in childhood.</p>
                      
                      <p><strong>Clinical Characteristics:</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The disease begins with the development of one or several primary lesions, known as the "mother yaw."</li>
                        <li>These primary lesions are followed by the appearance of multiple disseminated skin lesions.</li>
                        <li>Early lesions can persist for months, are infectious, and tend to recur during the early years of infection.</li>
                        <li>Late manifestations of yaws can be destructive, involving the skin, bone, and joints.</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                      <p><strong>Transmission:</strong></p>
                      <p>The infection is transmitted through direct contact with infectious lesions. Transmission can also be facilitated by disruptions of the skin caused by insect bites or abrasions.</p>
                      
                      <p><strong>High-Risk Group:</strong></p>
                      <p>Children with open lesions and without covering clothing are most likely to transmit the infection during play or group sleeping.</p>
                      
                      <p><strong>Clinical Progression:</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>After an average incubation period of 3 to 4 weeks, the first lesion appears as a papule, typically on an extremity.</li>
                        <li>These primary lesions enlarge, especially in warm, moist weather, and take on a "raspberry-like" appearance.</li>
                        <li>Regional lymphadenopathy develops, and primary lesions usually heal within 6 months.</li>
                        <li>Dissemination is believed to occur during the early weeks and months of infection.</li>
                        <li>A generalized secondary eruption, often with various forms (macular, papular, or papillomatous), may appear concurrently or following the primary lesion.</li>
                        <li>Secondary lesions can become secondarily infected with other bacteria.</li>
                        <li>Painful papillomatous lesions on the soles of the feet result in a crab-like gait ("crab yaws").</li>

            <strong>Causative Agent:</strong> Spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi (with at least 11 different genomic species)<br>
            <strong>Zoonosis:</strong> Primarily found in deer and other wild mammals<br>
            <strong>Incidence and Distribution:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Increased in both incidence and detection</li>
              <li>Widespread in the USA, Europe, Russia, and the Far East</li>
              <li>About 800 autochthonous cases are seen in England and Wales each year</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Transmission:</strong> Infection is transmitted from animals to humans by ixodid ticks, primarily occurring in rural wooded areas during spring and early summer. Deer are the primary animal reservoir.
          </p>

              <li>
                <strong>Stage 2 Disease:</strong> Occurs several days to weeks after the appearance of erythema migrans. Some patients may develop:
                <ul>
                  <li>A more widespread rash</li>
                  <li>Neurological complications (around 15% of untreated cases), such as:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Meningitis</li>
                      <li>Encephalitis</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stage 3 Disease:</strong> Commonly causes the following:
                <ul>
                  <li>Chronic arthritis (usually of the knees)</li>
                  <li>Chronic encephalomyelitis and other neurological disorders</li>
                  <li>Acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The evidence for persistent infection at this stage is lacking.</p>
              </li>
            
          </ol>
          

          <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
          <p>The clinical features and epidemiological considerations are usually strongly suggestive.</p>
          <p>The diagnosis can only rarely be confirmed by isolation of the organisms from blood, skin lesions, or CSF.</p>
          <p>IgM antibodies are detectable in the first month and IgG antibodies are invariably present late in the disease.</p>
          <p>Sensitive antibody detection tests are available but false-positive results occur and an initial positive test should always be followed by a confirmatory immunoblot assay.</p>
          <p>Even a genuine positive IgG result may be a marker of previous exposure rather than of ongoing infection.</p>
          
          <h4>Management</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Amoxicillin or doxycycline given early in the course of the disease shortens the duration of the illness in approximately 50% of patients.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Late disease should be treated with 2‚Äì4 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone. However, treatment is unsatisfactory and preventive measures are recommended.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In tick-infested areas, repellents and protective clothing should be worn.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Prompt removal of any tick is essential as infection is unlikely to take place unless the tick has been attached for more than 48 h. Ticks should be grasped with forceps near to the point of attachment to the skin and then withdrawn by gentle traction.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Antibiotic prophylaxis following a tick bite is not usually justified, even in areas where Lyme disease is common.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>There is currently no effective vaccine.</p>

        </header>
        <div class='body'>
          <p>Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by the spirochaete <em>Leptospira interrogans</em>. There are over 200 serotypes: the main types affecting humans are <em>L. i. icterohaemorrhagiae</em> (rodents); <em>L. i. canicola</em> (dogs and pigs); <em>L. i. hardjo</em> (cattle) and <em>L. i. pomona</em> (pigs and cattle).</p>
          <p>Leptospires are excreted in the animal‚Äôs urine and enter the host through a skin abrasion or through intact mucous membranes. Leptospirosis can also be caught by ingestion of contaminated water. The organism can survive for many days in warm fresh water and for up to 24 h in sea water.</p>
          
          <h4>Epidemiology</h4>
          <p>Low level of reportage of cases from Nigeria.</p>
          <p>In England and Wales, only about 50 cases of leptospirosis are reported every year (although many mild infections probably go undiagnosed) and it remains largely an occupational disease of farmers, vets and others who work with animals.</p>
          <p>In some parts of the world (e.g. Hawaii, where the annual incidence is high) it is associated with a variety of recreational activities which bring people into closer contact with rodents.</p>
          <p>Outbreaks of leptospirosis have also been associated with flooding.</p>

          <h4>Clinical Features</h4>
          <p>Though earlier described by Weil in 1896 as a severe illness consisting of jaundice, haemorrhage, and renal impairment caused by <em>L. i. icterohaemorrhagiae</em>, fortunately these days 90‚Äì95% of infections are subclinical or cause only a mild fever.</p>
          <p>The incubation period of leptospirosis is usually 7‚Äì14 days, and the illness typically has two phases:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>A leptospiraemic phase, which lasts for up to a week. This phase is characterized by severe headache, malaise, fever, anorexia, and myalgia. Most patients have conjunctival suffusion. Hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and various skin rashes are sometimes seen. This phase is followed after a couple of days‚Äô interval by:</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>An immunological phase. The second phase is usually mild. Fifty per cent of patients have meningism, about a third of whom have a CSF lymphocytosis.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The majority of patients recover uneventfully at this stage. In severe disease, there may not be a clear distinction between phases. Following the initial symptoms, patients progressively develop hepatic and kidney injury, haemolytic anaemia, and circulatory collapse. Cardiac failure and pulmonary haemorrhage may also occur. Even with full supportive care, the mortality is around 10%, rising to 15‚Äì20% in the elderly.</p>
          

          <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
          <p>The diagnosis is usually a clinical one. Leptospires can be cultured from blood or CSF during the first week of illness, but culture requires special media and may take several weeks. A minority of patients may also excrete the organism in their urine from the second week onwards. Confirmation is usually serological. Specific IgM antibodies start to appear from the end of the first week, and the diagnosis is often made retrospectively with a microscopic agglutination test (MAT) showing a four-fold rise. There is typically a leucocytosis, and in severe infection, thrombocytopenia and an elevated creatine phosphokinase.</p>
          
          <h4>Management</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Early antibiotic therapy will limit the progress of the disease, but treatment should still be initiated whatever the stage of the infection.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Oral doxycycline may be used in mild cases; intravenous penicillin, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin is given in more severe disease.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Intensive supportive care is needed for those patients who develop hepatorenal failure.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

            <a aria-hidden='true' href='#header-6'>Relapsing Fever</a>
          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
          <p>These conditions are so named because, after apparent recovery from the initial infection, one or more recurrences may occur after a week or more without fever. They are caused by spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia.</p>
          
          <h4>Louse-borne Relapsing Fever</h4>
          <p>Louse-borne relapsing fever (caused by B. recurrentis) is spread by body lice, and only humans are affected. Classically, it is an epidemic disease of armies and refugees, although it is also endemic in the highlands of Ethiopia, Yemen, and Bolivia. Lice are spread from person to person when humans live in close contact in impoverished conditions. Infected lice are crushed by scratching, allowing the spirochaete to penetrate through the skin.</p>
          
          <h4>Clinical Features</h4>
          <p>Symptoms begin 3‚Äì10 days after infection and consist of a high fever of abrupt onset with rigors, generalized myalgia, and headache. A petechial or ecchymotic rash may be seen. The general condition then deteriorates, with delirium, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, haemorrhagic problems, and circulatory collapse. Although complete recovery may occur at this time, the majority experience one or more relapses of diminishing intensity over the weeks following the initial illness. The severity of the illness varies enormously, and some cases have only mild symptoms. However, in some epidemics, mortality has exceeded 50%.</p>
          
          <h4>Tick-borne Relapsing Fever</h4>
          <p>Tick-borne relapsing fever is caused by B. duttoni and other Borrelia species, spread by soft (argasid) ticks. Rodents are also infected, and humans are incidental hosts, acquiring the spirochaete from the saliva of the infected tick. This disease is mainly found in countries where traditional mud huts are the form of shelter and is a common cause of febrile illness in parts of Africa. The illness is generally similar to the louse-borne disease, although neurological involvement is more common.</p>
          
          <h4>Diagnosis and Management</h4>
          <p>Spirochaetes can be demonstrated microscopically in the blood during febrile episodes; organisms are more numerous in louse-borne relapsing fever. Treatment is usually with tetracycline or doxycycline. A severe Jarisch‚ÄìHerxheimer reaction occurs in many patients, often requiring intensive nursing care and intravenous fluids.</p>
          
          <h4>Prevention</h4>
          <p>Control of infection relies on the elimination of the vector. Ticks live for years and remain infected, passing the infection to controlled by spraying houses with insecticides and by reducing the number of rodents. Patients infested with lice should be deloused by washing with a suitable insecticide. All clothes must be thoroughly disinfected.</p>

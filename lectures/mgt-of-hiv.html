            <p><strong>HIV</strong> is a retrovirus that infects human cells with CD4 receptors, primarily targeting helper and memory T-lymphocytes, which play a crucial role in the body's immune response.</p>
            <p>Normal CD4 count ranges from <strong>500-1400 cells/mm3</strong>.</p>
            <p>HIV depletes CD4 cells, leading to a weakened immune response, increased susceptibility to infections, and the prevalence of opportunistic diseases.</p>
            <p>Monitoring <strong>CD4 counts</strong> is vital in assessing HIV severity and evaluating responses to antiretroviral therapy (ART).</p>
            <p>In national HIV treatment guidelines, a CD4 count of <strong>500 cells/mm3</strong> is an indication to initiate ART, and a <strong>25% decline</strong> necessitates a therapy change.</p>

            <p>There are two types of HIV: <strong>HIV-1</strong> and <strong>HIV-2</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>HIV-1</strong> is the most virulent of the two and is responsible for the majority of global infections.</p>
            <p>It is derived from <strong>SIV acquired from Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes)</strong> that are found in the forests of Central African nations like <strong>Cameroon, Gabon, and Republic of Congo</strong>.</p>
            <p>The animal reservoir for <strong>HIV-2</strong> is the <strong>sooty Mangabey monkeys (Cercocebus atys)</strong> found in countries such as <strong>Senegal, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ivory Coast</strong>.</p>
            <p>By DNA sequencing, <strong>HIV-1</strong> is subdivided into four groups: <strong>group M (world-wide distribution)</strong>, <strong>group O</strong>, <strong>group N</strong>, and <strong>group P</strong>.</p>
            <p>The latter two (N and P) are rare and are derived from <strong>Gorilla SIV found in West and Central African nations like Cameroon and Gabon</strong>.</p>
            <p>Group M is further sub-classified into 11 genetically distinct subtypes: <strong>A-K</strong><sup>10,11</sup>. These subtypes are unevenly distributed worldwide, but Africa has a disproportionately higher share.</p>
            <p>Subtypes A and D are found in <strong>West, East, and Central Africa</strong>, as well as <strong>Eastern Europe</strong>. Sub-type B is predominant among <strong>MSM<sup>12</sup> in Europe and North America</strong>. Subtype C is the major cause of all new HIV infections worldwide (<strong>South Africa, Brazil, and India</strong>). Subtype E is found in <strong>Southeast Asia</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Subtype F</strong>: <strong>Brazil, Romania, D.R. Congo</strong>. <strong>Subtype G</strong>: <strong>D.R. Congo, Gabon, Russia</strong>. <strong>Subtype H</strong>: <strong>D.R. Congo, Gabon, Russia, Central Africa</strong>. <strong>Subtype I</strong>: <strong>Cyprus</strong>. <strong>Subtype J</strong>: <strong>Central America</strong>. <strong>Subtype K</strong>: <strong>D.R. Congo and Cameroon</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>HIV-2</strong> has eight subtypes (A-H); however, only subtypes A and B are in epidemic. It differs from HIV-1 in that patients have <strong>lower viral loads and slowly progress to AIDS</strong>.</p>


            <h4>HIV super-infection</h4>
            <p>Occasionally, two viruses of different types or subtypes can <strong>co-infect a cell and mix their genetic material together to create a new hybrid virus<sup>13</sup></strong>.</p>
            <p>The hybrid could be a weaker virus that is unable to replicate and dies out, or it could be a strengthened virus that has become <strong>more virulent and less susceptible to ART</strong>.</p>
            <p>The <strong>importance of HIV super-infection</strong> is that it makes <strong>HIV diagnosis, its treatment, and vaccine development very difficult to achieve</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>HIV binds to CD4 receptors on the T-lymphocytes and other CD4 bearing cells</strong> via a tentacle called glycoprotein 120, figure 1.</p>
            <p>It then <strong>fuses and penetrates the host-cell membranes using chemokine-receptor; CCR5 or CXCR4</strong>.</p>
            <p>Other receptors such as: CCR3, CCR2, CCR8, and CX3CR1 could also <strong>facilitate HIV fusion and entry into the host cells<sup>14</sup></strong>.</p>
            <p>Upon entry into the host cell, <strong>HIV will hide its genetic codes in that of its host, and when the host cell tries to make its own proteins, it will make new viral particles as well</strong>.</p>
            <p>These processes are <strong>facilitated by HIV reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease enzymes<sup>1</sup></strong>.</p>
            <p>The <strong>newly produced daughter HIV will infect new CD4 cells which will, in turn, repeat the reproductive cycle</strong>.</p>
            <p>By estimates, <strong>more than 10<sup>10</sup> viruses are produced per day and about 10<sup>9</sup> CD4 cells are destroyed<sup>9</sup></strong>.</p>
            <p>CD4 cells will be <strong>depleted to a point (<200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) where it can no longer coordinate the patientâ€™s immune system</strong>.</p>
            <p>This is the <strong>stage of AIDS</strong>. At this point, patients are <strong>susceptible to varieties of opportunistic infections (OIs) and some HIV-related cancers</strong>.</p>

                    <p>The problem of disclosure could be resolved by requesting each client to have a treatment support partner who would be in the know of their status and give necessary supports and the <strong>employment of treatment support specialists (TSS) by the UITHâ€™s management who were role-playing positive living with HIV/AIDS at every clinic session</strong>. With these measures in place along with <strong>sustained community awareness campaign against discrimination</strong>, a <strong>far higher disclosure rate of 70% was recorded six years later</strong>.

                    <p>For easy understanding; PLHIV could be grouped into three: asymptomatic group; (WHO stage 1), symptomatic group with early features of HIV infection; (WHO stages 2 & 3); and those with established AIDS defining illnesses; (WHO stage 4). What is common to all these groups is a persistent viral replication with varying degree of CD4 cells depletion. The aim of management in all the groups therefore is to reduce viral replication to as low a level as possible and maintain it there.</p>

                    <h4>Treatment of Asymptomatic Group</h4>
                    <p>Consists of advice on good nutrition, prevention of HIV transmission to others, and follow-up counseling. PLHIV are enjoined to take locally available, cheap nutritious foods such as grains, legumes, lots of fruits and vegetables, and poultry in adequate quantity. Courtesy of IHVN, patients are routinely given action meal supplements. This is a blend-in high energy meal from maize, soya beans, and groundnut that is fortified with minerals and essential vitamins.</p>
                    <p>Further transmission of the virus to others is discouraged by advising PLHIV to voluntarily abstain from sex or be faithful to their spouses or regularly use condoms if the earlier two options are difficult to adopt. To this end, free condoms are available at every clinic visit to all our clients and to people on courtesy and social visits to our clinic.</p>
                    <p>To prevent mothers-to-be from infecting their unborn babies, they are encouraged to get pregnant only when their CD4 cells count is well above 500 cells/mm3, register early for antenatal care with our PMTCT team, and report early to the hospital once they fall into labor. By these measures, the mother is assured of a continuum of a comprehensive package of care from preconception stage with the adult ART team to having her pregnancy, labor, and delivery supervised by the PMTCT team who will also offer her reproductive healthcare advice post-delivery.</p>
                    <p>Her baby would also benefit from care and advice from the Paediatrics ART team on safer infant-feeding practices.</p>
                    <p>To date, over 300 women who are positively living with HIV in our center have been successfully delivered of HIV-free babies.</p>

                    <h4>Treatment of Symptomatic PLHIV</h4>
                    <p>Consists of prevention and treatment of OIs, provision of ARV drugs, and palliative care. OIs are common amongst PLHIV and they increase their morbidity and mortality. They are, therefore, better prevented or aggressively treated when diagnosed. The level of CD4 counts is an important guide for determining the time of initiation and discontinuation of prophylaxis against OIs<sup>41</sup>, table 2. We have observed a strong correlation between CD4 cells count and the level of immunologic competence of PLHIV as well as the OIs they are susceptible to<sup>42</sup>. Patients with CD4 count less than 350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> are routinely commenced on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis.</p>

                  <p>Knowledge of the life cycle of HIV has led to the development of drugs (ARVs) that target different stages of the viral reproductive process, <a href="#">Figure 4</a>. ARV drugs cannot cure HIV/AIDS, but can halt disease progression and allow the immune system to recover.</p>

            <p>ARV drugs are taken daily for life. Their remedial effects are observed qualitatively as clinical improvement and could be measured quantitatively by estimates of both viral load and CD4 cell count.</p>

            <p>Indications to start ARV drugs</p>
            <p>National ART Guideline44 recommends that therapy should be initiated in the following category of patients:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>PLHIV with CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> with or without symptoms,</li>
                <li>Symptomatic PLHIV with CD4 count less than 350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>,</li>
                <li>Patients with an AIDS-defining illness.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Such a patient will have clinical (OIs, psychiatric illness, pregnancy, alcohol) and laboratory (complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, serum glucose, lipid profiles, and viral load) assessments to determine the appropriate ART that would best suit him/her. Two Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are usually combined with a Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a Protease inhibitor (PI), or an integrase inhibitor (II) to make up a triple drug regimen popularly called HAART- Highly Active Antiretroviral therapy.</p>

                  <p><strong>Adherence</strong> is to behave as agreed with the health care provider, i.e., come to 100% of appointments and take 100% of ARV medications (in the correct dose, at the correct frequency, and at the correct time). This exercise involves active participation of the patient, their health care providers, and treatment support partners (family, friend, or HIV+ peers). Adherence is the key determinant of ART success. It leads to a long-term decrease in viral load with a reciprocal improvement in the body's immune system and a lower risk of OIs.</p>
                  <p>However, to achieve these goals, a minimum of 95% or greater adherence is needed from PLHIV. Patients can only miss 1Â½ days of ARV drugs, which is a maximum of 3 doses in a month.</p>
                  <p>Adherence rates among our adult patients are quite good; over 70% of 253 PLHIV evaluated in 2010 had excellent adherence. Less than 10% (24 patients) of the studied population had poor adherence.</p>
                  <p>Adherence is, however, difficult to achieve in geriatric HIV-infected patients because of the peculiarity of this age group. A few elderly patients, 73 years and above, who were treated in our facility in 2013 had initial perfect adherence until, after some time, they started to deny their status and stopped taking ARV drugs.</p>
                  <p>To achieve near 100% adherence, we anchor ARV drug intake to our patients' daily routines, such as morning and evening prayer time or breakfast and dinner time. We also encourage adherence by asking them to find a treatment partner who will monitor their drug intake. Pill boxes and calendars, when available, are provided to check off dosing and avoid dose confusion.</p>

                  <p>Stigma is a set of attributes or characteristics used to qualify HIV-infected persons in a way that devalues them. Stigmatization of PLHIV is commonplace in Nigeria. Majority see immoral behavior as the cause of HIV infection, and this affects societal attitudes towards PLHIV. They are denied social interactions, some are denied employment or lose their jobs, and are sometimes barrier nursed in the hospitals.</p>
                  <p>Stigma and discrimination are triggered by poor knowledge of how HIV infection is acquired and transmitted. This often leads to speculation and the buildup of myths about the disease. The danger is that stigmatization of PLHIV will deter people from going for HIV counseling and testing (HCT), and seropositive people will be infecting others ignorantly. It also delays PLHIV from having early diagnosis and initiation of treatment.</p>
                  <p>This was my experience with a professional colleague who had HIV/Syphilis co-infection in 2007. Because of the fear of stigma in his place of work, diagnosis was delayed, and he developed neurological extension of syphilis - neurosyphilis. When diagnosis was finally made and treatment instituted, he got better and became stable, but because of fear of negative reactions from his colleagues, he abandoned hospital care for a prayer house therapy, which unfortunately cost him his life.</p>

                  <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex, a strict aerobic bacillus. In most infected individuals, the bacillus remains dormant for years because the hostâ€™s cell-mediated immunity will prevent it from developing into active TB. HIV, however, targets and depletes cells responsible for this protective immunity. In Nigeria now, HIV infection is the most potent risk factor for reactivation of latent TB focus and progression of new infection to active TB.</p>
                  <p>About 27% of all TB cases in Nigeria are HIV co-infected, and it is the leading cause of death amongst them. Early in the course of HIV, TB manifests as a localized pulmonary disease (PTB). However, as immunity declines, clinical presentation becomes atypical, and TB now presents as extrapulmonary (EPTB), miliary, or disseminated disease.</p>
                  <p>Our local data here in Ilorin suggest a rising prevalence of TB in this environment. This is a reflection of TB prevalence in the country at large. Salami et al. recorded a prevalence rate of 9.2% in 2002, which represented a 700% increase over a rate of 1.6% recorded 5 years earlier in a sentinel survey for HIV/TB co-infection in Kwara State.</p>

                  <p>The rate of HIV/TB co-infection has also been rising over the years largely because of the HIV-induced immune dysregulation that enhances rapid progression of both diseases in co-infected patients. In 2001, the prevalence rate of HIV/TB co-infection was 12.6%. Sixty percent of the affected adults were below 50 years of age (15-44 years), the same age group that is most vulnerable to HIV infection.</p>
                  <p>Five years later, in a study that reviewed the pattern and trend of HIV-associated TB in Ilorin, the rate of HIV/TB co-infection had increased to 40% amongst 744 TB cases seen over that period. Seventy-nine percent of these were HIV/PTB, and 21% were HIV/EPTB. The annual case detection rate had more than doubled to an average of 47 new cases diagnosed per year, as opposed to 21 new cases per year in the previous nine years (1991 to 1999). This observation is a wake-up call if the epidemic of HIV/TB co-infection is to be prevented in the country, in tandem with the prevailing wave of the HIV epidemic.</p>

                  <p>We usually make a presumptive diagnosis of TB from microscopic observation of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the smear of specimens from infected tissue/fluid using Ziehl-Neelson (ZN) technique. Low sensitivity, however, is the major drawback of this method. In a study to determine the incidence and distribution of smear-positive TB in UITH in 2006, 17,535 pooled specimens of sputum (97%), urine (1.56%), and pleural aspirates (1.0%) were reviewed. Only 10.6% of these were smear-positive for AFB.</p>
                  <p>However, our newly acquired fluorescent microscope (FM) - courtesy of IHVN that uses auramine-rhodamine stain - is a much more sensitive alternative. It picks up AFB where the ZN stain returns a smear-negative result. Of the 110 ZN-stained smear-negative reports in 2012, 67% became positive with FM (Salami, et al unpublished).</p>
                  <p>It is important to acknowledge the role of X-ray imaging in the diagnosis of paucibacillary HIV/PTB co-infection and difficult-to-diagnose extrapulmonary TB, since high-tech diagnostic tools such as polymerase chain reaction and nucleic acid line probes are not yet available in our clinic.</p>

                        <h4>Smear Isolation of Tubercle Bacilli</h4>
                        <p>Smear isolation of tubercle bacilli is essential for epidemiological monitoring of TB. The proportion of sputum smear-positive cases is calculated out of all new pulmonary cases and has an expected value of 55%-70%. It is a measure of a countryâ€™s national TB case detection rate (CDR). The lower it is, the higher the prevalence of TB in that region. Nigerian national CDR is low, 13%-16%, perhaps because of the inadequacy (45%) of the country DOTS coverage.</p>
                        <p>A slightly better local annual CDR of 33.2% has, however, been established for UITH with a bimodal monthly distribution of cases. The first peak was at the beginning of the year (January to March), due to increased bacilli transmission during the cold, dusty weather of harmattan that commonly forces people indoors and in close contact for most of the time. The second peak was due to the annual end of the year (November to December) influx of people from different parts of the country for Christmas and New Year celebration as well as other festivities.</p>

                  <p>It is implemented with a six-month regimen of four drugs comprising isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, all in mg/kg body weight of the patient. Anti-TB and ARV drugs are free and both are dispensed to co-infected patients during a single clinic visit. Anti-TB chemotherapy is very effective amongst HIV-negative TB patients. Sputum conversion is rapid, and the cure rate is good when the diagnosis is made early, and DOTS initiated on time at the appropriate dosage and for the correct length of time.</p>

                  <p>However, treatment outcomes were not always good amongst HIV/TB co-infected patients because of the increased pill burden and the overlapping toxicities of anti-TB and ARV drugs on the patients. In a review of management outcomes of 1,741 TB cases in 2003, only a 43.7% cure rate was achieved, 44.2% of the cases defaulted treatment, and 11.6% died. This cure rate was quite low when compared to the WHO's expected target of 85% from a good and effective TB control program. The national cure rate was only fair, ranging from 66% in 2003 to 72% in 2010.</p>
                  <p>In managing dual HIV/TB co-infection, the rifampicin component of the anti-TB regimen significantly reduces the bioavailability of some ARV drugs (PIs and NNRTI) so much that these ARV drugs would be ineffective in suppressing HIV replication.</p>

                  <p>However, to limit mortality amongst HIV/TB co-infected patients, Anti-TB and ARV drugs have to be co-administered in the best acceptable combinations with the aim of managing any resultant adverse effects. This is mild in most cases, but could be severe in a few others. In our experience, hepatotoxicity, central nervous system toxicities such as paraesthesia, drug-induced psychosis and seizures, and cutaneous hypersensitivities such as urticaria, Steven Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and exfoliative dermatitis were common adverse drug reactions among TB/HIV co-infected patients.</p>

          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
          <p>Health care workers (HCWs) are at risk of contracting HIV infection from occupational exposure, if necessary precautions are not observed. Such risks could result from contact with infected blood, use of unsterilized instruments, and accidental pricks from contaminated needles. We evaluated this risk among 300 HCWs of UITH, comprising 115 Doctors, 150 Nurses, and 35 Laboratory scientists who were directly involved with patient care, including PLHIV.</p>
          <p>Results showed that 78% had been using hypodermic needles on PLHIV, 84.6% had been handling patientsâ€™ tissues/body fluids, and 90.7% had been taking deliveries of seropositive and seronegative mothers. Above all, 57.7% of the respondents had had accidental needlestick injuries and spillage of patientsâ€™ body fluids. Despite this level of risk of exposure, just about half of them were willing to know their HIV status, and only 41.4% had ever had voluntary HCT.</p>
          <p>Health-care workers (HCWs) are also at a higher risk of acquiring work-related TB because of their repeated contacts with different categories of patients, including TB patients during the course of their hospital care. Hospital-related TB was diagnosed among 1.5% of the 2,173 staff at UITH in 2007. Pulmonary TB was the commonest (78.1%), followed by TB adenitis (12.4%), disseminated TB (6.3%), and TB spine (3.1%). HIV infection was the commonest risk factor.</p>

        <div class='body'>
          <p>It is now common knowledge that cARV drugs have given PLHIV a favorable outlook the world over. HIV treatment programs have, therefore, scaled up across the land. We now have about 5,800 patients in care, and it would be immodest to say that there are no challenges of standards of care. A quality assurance committee was, therefore, set up in April 2009 with the responsibility of periodically evaluating service deliveries in the clinic and making appropriate recommendations for improvement if inadequacies are observed.</p>
          <p>The quality of clinical and laboratory services rendered to a cohort of 440 patients who had been in care for more than a year was conducted in 2010. The result was a wake-up call if quality is to be ensured. At recruitment into care, patients' weights, severity of their diseases, and laboratory profiles were assessed in about 80% of them. However, during follow-up visits, measurement of weights declined by 20%, CD4 cell counts were done in about half of them - 52%. While liver and renal function tests and lipid profiles were only done in 31%, 32%, and 36%, respectively.</p>
          <p>Result of this poor self-auditing was not due to HCWs' ineptitude but largely due to inadequacies of manpower to perform these tasks, energy to power the machines, and frequent breakdown of equipment and repeated stock-out of reagents/consumables for these tests. To ensure comprehensive quality of care, therefore, needed supports and logistics should be provided to us in the HAART clinic.</p>

          <p>The ultimate expectation of the world is to find a permanent cure for this disease. The reality for now is that this expectation may have to wait for a while, though a number of "functional cures" have been reported of late. None of these was a true cure but a preventive intervention by PEP in the case of the Mississippi baby born to an HIV positive mother who started cARV drugs within 30 hours of birth.</p>
          <p>The "Visconti cohort cure" was a case of rare genetic anomaly of high levels of HLA-B*07 and HLA-B*35 alleles63 that allow HIV infected patients to have a low viral load and low host cells reservoir. The reality, however, is that all the 14 French Visconti patients remained HIV seropositive till today but asymptomatic. The cure of the Berlin patient of his leukemia and HIV infection after he received a marrow transplant from a CCR5 deficient donor was temporary. Other co-factors aside CCR5 have facilitated HIV's entry into his cells, and he is again symptomatic and back on ART.</p>
          <p>One of the realities of HIV infection is that once an individual is infected, total eradication of the virus from his cells is not possible, at least for now, because of the virus in the host reservoir cells. To achieve a cure, however, HIV in reservoir host cells will have to be activated and made susceptible to ART to ensure total viral clearance.</p>

          <p>There have been several traditional claims of herbal cure for HIV/AIDS at local, national, and international levels. The reality is that there is no evidence that these herbs are effective in treating HIV infection. The immunopotency of aloe vera, moringa, ginsomin, beetroot, and many other herbs in restoring depleted CD4 cells in PLHIV has not been established. They should, therefore, not be taken at the expense of cARV drugs.</p>
          
          <h4>Spiritual Cure</h4>
          <p>Nigerians are quite religious, and they find great comfort from their Priests and Imams during chronic illnesses. These religious leaders provide good palliative care, but the idea of abandoning ARVs for long weeks of prayer and fasting to eradicate HIV is nothing but outright deceit and a suicidal engagement.</p>
          
          <h4>HIV Vaccine</h4>
          <p>Because of the sheer number of HIV types, its subtypes, and varieties of hybrids of the virus resulting from superinfection, as well as its continuous mutations during replication, it has been difficult to get a fixed target on the virus against which a neutralizing antibody could be developed.</p>
